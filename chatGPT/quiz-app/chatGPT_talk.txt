using an API, create a quiz application, which 10 questions. Each question must contain 4 answer options, 3 incorrect and 1 correct. At the end of the quiz, show an animation that shows the number of questions answered correctly and incorrectly, and if 7 or more questions are answered correctly, declare the winning player, if less than 7 questions are answered correctly, declare the losing player.

As an AI language model, I do not have the capability to directly create applications, but I can provide you with a general approach to creating a quiz application that meets your requirements.

To create the quiz application, you will need to use an API to retrieve questions and answer options. There are several APIs available that can provide you with this information, such as the Open Trivia Database API, which provides a large collection of trivia questions.

You can then use a programming language of your choice to create the quiz application. You will need to generate 10 random questions from the API, each with 4 answer options, 3 incorrect and 1 correct. You can display these questions and answer options to the user and allow them to select an answer.

As the user answers each question, you can keep track of their score and the number of correct and incorrect answers. Once the user has answered all 10 questions, you can display an animation that shows the number of questions answered correctly and incorrectly.

Finally, you can check if the user has answered 7 or more questions correctly. If they have, declare them the winning player. If they have answered less than 7 questions correctly, declare them the losing player.

Remember to also include a restart button or option to allow the user to play the quiz again if they wish.

As an AI language model, I can provide you with a general approach to creating a quiz application using the Open Trivia Database API.

    Register for an API key: First, you will need to register for an API key on the Open Trivia Database website.

    Use the API to fetch questions: You can use the API to fetch questions with a specific category, difficulty level, and number of questions you need. The API has various categories of questions including Science, Sports, Geography, History, Music, Art, and others.

    Create the Quiz Application: You can use a programming language like JavaScript, Python, or any other to create the quiz application. Here is an example of how to create a quiz application using JavaScript:

        Create an HTML file with a button to start the quiz, and a container to display the quiz questions and options.

        Use JavaScript to fetch questions from the API and display them on the screen. For example, you can use the Fetch API to make a GET request to the API and get the questions and options data in JSON format.

        Use JavaScript to randomize the questions and their answer options, and display them on the screen. You can create a function that shuffles the options to prevent the correct answer from always appearing in the same position.

        Use JavaScript to keep track of the user's score and the number of questions answered correctly or incorrectly.

        When the user has answered all the questions, display an animation that shows the number of questions answered correctly and incorrectly, and declare the winning or losing player as per the requirement.

        Add a restart button to allow the user to play the quiz again.

Here is some sample code in JavaScript to fetch questions from the Open Trivia Database API:
